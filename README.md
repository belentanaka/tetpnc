# Description

An arcade-style Tetris clone made using Simple DirectMedia Layer. I have implemented wall kicks, holding, and high scores.

All textures, sounds, and music were made by me.

**This was made for educational purposes only.**

# Controls

- *Left/Right* - Move the block left or right.
- *Down* - Make the block fall at a faster rate.
- *Space* - Drop the block immediately (hard drop).
- *x/Up* - Rotate the block clockwise.
- *z* - Rotate the block counterclockwise.
- *c* - Hold the block.
- *Escape* - Pause/Unpause the game.
